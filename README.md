# Quote-Generator
this is a quote generator that gives you random quotes When you press the button.
This should be a testimony to my gradual progress in learning JavaScript.
I want to show everyone that it is possible to learn to program but it takes time and patience.
I added an array of objects in my javascript, and then I created a function that took the length of the
array and gave us a random index.
Then I prescribed each following variable an index of random, then added the corresponding name.
Which grabbed its value.

feel free to reach out and give me free tips.
